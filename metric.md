The Silhouette Coefficient is a metric that evaluates how well data points in a cluster are grouped with other similar points. A high Silhouette Coefficient suggests that the clustering model is both dense, meaning that points within the same cluster are similar to each other, and well-separated, meaning that points in different clusters are not very similar to each other.

To calculate the Silhouette Coefficient for a data point, the average distance between the point and all other points in the same cluster `a` is compared to the average distance between the point and all points in the nearest neighboring cluster `b`. The Silhouette Coefficient for a data point is then computed as:
$$ s = \frac{b - a}{max(a, b)} $$

It's important to note that the Silhouette Coefficient is only defined for datasets with at least `2` labels, and that the labels must be between `0` and `n_clusters - 1`. The Silhouette Coefficient is defined for each sample and is calculated as the mean of the Silhouette Coefficient for each sample.

$$ 2 <= n_{labels} <= n_{samples} - 1 $$
where `n_labels` is the number of distinct clusters and `n_samples` is the total number of data points.

The Silhouette Coefficient returns a score between -1 and 1, with a score of 1 indicating that the clustering model is excellent, a score of 0 indicating that clusters overlap, and a score of -1 indicating that the clustering model is poor.
