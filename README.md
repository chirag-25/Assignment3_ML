# Assignment3_ML

Visualise (using voronoi partitions) different clustering methods like KDE and DBSCAN on different datasets with varying complexity. Use the sklearn.datasets make_blobs function to create the dataset.

## [DBSCAN](dbscan.md)

## [KDE](kde.md)

## Metrics(metric.md)

Here we have used the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithms:
`Silhouette Score`: The silhouette score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better clustering performance.
